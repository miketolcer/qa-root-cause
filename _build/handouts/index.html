<h1>Root Cause Analysis</h1>
<p>Good news! A new version of Employee Manager is now available to you!</p>
<p>Here we have the new Employee Manager version 1.2 documentation: <a class="reference external" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.2_README.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.2_README.html</a></p>
<p>Take the next 30 minutes and compare your previous Employee Manager notes you have and add in any new information you can pull from the documentation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There may be new features added</p></li>
<li><p>Some old issues may have been fixed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now take some more time and run some of your previous tests again! We’ll get into why we re-run tests in the future. For now the idea is to make sure the features that were previously working are still continuing to work.</p>
<p>After doing some re-testing and making sure the website is working correctly, make a list of items you would like to see as a user for Employee Manager.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Notes on design/user flow</p></li>
<li><p>What features are listed to be added in the docs?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you want to see these features implemented?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the issues brought up by the customer in a previous lab were not fully addressed, list out some possible reasons that these issues were not addressed.</p>
<p>Take the next 30 minutes and write out an update to that customer, and how you would take action to address the issues that have not been fixed.</p>
<p>And lastly, write up a report as if it were being sent to a QA manager giving them updates on all the work you’ve done so far for Employee Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Push your work to your GitHub account so that your education team can review your work.</strong></p>
